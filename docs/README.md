# CST1510 – Week 8: Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform (Database Layer)

This project implements the full database layer for the **Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform** as required in **CST1510 Week 8**.  
It replaces the Week 7 file-based storage (users.txt) with a fully structured **SQLite database**, including secure authentication, CRUD operations, CSV ingestion, and a modular application architecture.


## Project Overview

The objective of Week 8 is to transition from simple text-file storage to a proper database system.  
This includes:

- Migrating data from `users.txt` into SQLite  
- Creating multiple domain tables  
- Implementing secure, parameterised SQL queries  
- Building CRUD operations for all domains  
- Loading external CSV datasets using `pandas`  
- Demonstrating functionality via an executable `main.py` script  

The final project closely follows professional backend development practices and prepares the system for Week 9 (Streamlit web interface).
